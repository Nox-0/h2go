I have met all moral requirements by not using or creating content that I find offensive. I personally do not find water offensive. Water is also a basic necessity and I therefore firmly believe that it would not offend the general public. Since it's needed to stay alive. If they are offended, they can contact me at dan.bublik@shirley.school.nz and I will happily address their concerns. I have met all legal obligations by staying within the law whilst creating the website and database.
